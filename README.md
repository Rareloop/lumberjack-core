**If you've recieved value from Lumberjack we'd hugely appreciate it if you could donate to our [Ecologi forest](https://ecologi.com/rareloop?r=60618d1bcdd7a4001d7b86f2) and help us plant real life trees to combat the climate crisis. Compared to the cost of developing a framework like Lumberjack, a few trees per project is a bargain and makes a positive difference to the environment.**
